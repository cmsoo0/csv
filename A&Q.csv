"Commissioning, Startup, Operation, and Shutdown",WARNING,Failure to follow these precautions before you start the unit will lead to serious personal injury and equipment failure.
"Commissioning, Startup, Operation, and Shutdown",WARNING,Do not operate the pump below the minimum rated flows or with the suction or discharge valves closed
"Commissioning, Startup, Operation, and Shutdown",NOTICE,Verify the driver settings before you start any pump.
"Commissioning, Startup, Operation, and Shutdown",NOTICE,Make sure that the temperature change does not exceed 35Â°F (19Â°C) per minute.
Maintenance inspections,Explanation,Shorten the inspection intervals appropriately if the pumped fluid is abrasive or corrosive or if the environment is classified as potentially explosive.
Routine inspections,Check,"Check for unusual noise, vibration, and bearing temperatures."
Install the coupling guard,Requirements,"1. End plate, drive end"
Ex-approved products,Requirements,All work on the product must be carried out by certified electricians and ITT-authorized mechanics. Special rules apply to installations in explosive atmospheres.
level the baseplate,Install,1. Lower the baseplate carefully onto the foundation bolts.
level the baseplate,Install,Use the equipment mounting surfaces in order to establish the level.
Casing areas to inspect,When,"When you see cracks, pitting, or corrosion damage"
Impeller replacement,When,When grooved deeper than 1/16 in. (1.6 mm)
Wash the skin and eyes,Condition,Chemicals or hazardous fluids in eyes
Wash the skin and eyes,Action,3. Seek medical attention.

Installation_Preinstallation,WARNING,"When installing in a potentially explosive environment, make sure that the motor is properly certified."
Baseplate-mounting procedures,Prepare,1. Chip the top of the foundation to a minimum of 1.0 in. (25.0 mm) in order to remove porous or low-strength concrete.
Baseplate-mounting procedures,NOTICE,Do not use oils or liquid wax.
Pump-to-driver alignmen,Alignment methods,Detailed instructions for using the dial indicator method are contained in this chapter.
Permitted indicator values for alignment checks,IMPORTANT,The tolerance of the indicator is 0.0005 in./in. (0.0127 mm/mm) of indicator separation at operating temperature
Perform parallel alignment for a vertical correction,Then,The pump coupling half (X) is lower than the driver coupling half (Y). 
Perform complete alignment for a vertical correction,Prepare,4. Make corrections according to the separate instructions for angular and parallel alignment until you obtain the permitted reading values.
Grout the baseplate,Requirements,5. Allow the grout to set.
Piping checklists,Check,The hold-down bolts for the pump are tightened.
Alignment criteria for pump flanges,Type,Concentric
Discharge piping checklist,Explanation,The isolation valve is required for
Auxiliary-piping checklist,Install,"You may need to install auxiliary piping for bearing cooling, seal-chamber cover cooling, mechanical seal flush, or other special features supplied with the pump. "
Final piping checklist,Explanation,Rotate the shaft by hand.
